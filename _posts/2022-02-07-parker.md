# Howdy!

My name is Parker Mott and I am a Junior student at Texas A&M. 

# What I do With My free Time

With my free time I enjoy playing basketball and hangingout with my friends. I also love traveling. 
I spend most of my summer visiting new places. I also love animals.

# How I Work in a Group

I am not a person that likes to lead. I'm the type of person that likes to be told exactly what needs to be done and I'll do it.
I actively and consistenly try to communicate with the team to make sure we are all on the same page. Overall I try to do my part, 
and I'm always willing to help anyone else in the group.
