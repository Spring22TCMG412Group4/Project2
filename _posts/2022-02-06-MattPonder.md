# Interests

I love the outdoors; My major hobbies include: snowboarding, rock climbing, 
hammock camping and more.
I also really enjoy coffee in all of it's aspects. I have worked at a local

work every day.

# How I Work with the Team

I don't always push myself to facilitate growth in projects, but I step up to 
lead if the need arises. For the most part, I just want to contribute what is 
expected of me plus a little more. I have a strong beleif in the importance of 
fairness, and do everything in my ability to help those struggling.
