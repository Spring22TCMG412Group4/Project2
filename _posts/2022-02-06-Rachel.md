## Howdy!

My name is Rachel Talkington. I am a Senior Technology Management Major, Business Minor from Carrollton, Texas.

I am currently a member of the Texas A&M Corps of Cadets and the Fightin' Texas Aggie Band within the unit C-Company. In addition to this I am the Commanding Officer (sort of like club president) of the Corps Center Guard (pictured below).
