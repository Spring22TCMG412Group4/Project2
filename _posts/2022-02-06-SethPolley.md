# Howdy! 
My name is Seth Polley.
I am a senior TCMG major from Denton, TX.
I enjoy fishing, hunting, and camping. One of my goals this year is to go on several camping trips with my friends and brothers.


Please enjoy this image of me and my brothers!

# How I Work with the Team

I am eager to constantly be learning useful tools and skills. I am a team player, and will happily sacrifice my time to make sure the team achieves it's objective.
I am not afraid to take charge, but I am also willing to go along with whoever had the strongest opinion.
